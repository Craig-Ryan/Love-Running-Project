# Love Running project as part of Code Institute Fullstack Web Developer course

## Here is my Love Running project completed as part of my HTML CSS sections in the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course.

I used external CSS and HTML to create this project.

The project consists of three different pages consisting of information regarding a fictional running club in Dublin City Center. Each page has functional links within that allow a user to navigate between the different pages. The CSS file styles each page with images, custom backgrounds and interactive inputs such as a sign up sheet as well as social media links. The pages are fully responsive to suit all devices.

The result is a simple and stylish website that is ready to be published and enjoyed by users.
